# Downloading Training Music
Downloading the music is done by using cli program `yt-dlp`. And `yt-dlp` uses `ffmpeg` or `avconc` to convert videos to audio files.
If you have these programs in your system you should be able to download the training music by running the `download.sh` in any UNIX compliant shell.
